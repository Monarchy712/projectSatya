# 🚀 Infrastructure Reporting System — Full Implementation Guide

This document defines the complete end-to-end system for integrating the reporting pipeline into the website.

The system enables:
- frictionless reporting (no wallet required)
- ML-based validation
- IPFS-based storage
- blockchain-backed immutability
- pseudonymous accountability

---

# 🧭 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

User → ML Validation → IPFS → Backend → Blockchain

User submits report  
↓  
ML validates images + text  
↓  
If valid → upload to IPFS  
↓  
Generatex CID  
↓  
Backend signs transaction  
↓  
Store CID on blockchain  

---

# 🧩 COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE

## 1. FRONTEND (Website)

### UI Requirements:
- Multiple image upload
- Description textbox
- Submit button
- Status display

---

## FRONTEND FLOW

### Step 1: User Input
User provides:
- images (multiple)
- description (text)

---

### Step 2: Send to ML

POST /ml/validate

Request:
{
  "images": [...],
  "description": "text"
}

---

## 2. ML VALIDATION LAYER

### Input:
- uploaded images
- user description

### Output:
{
  "confidence": 0.0 - 1.0
}

---

### Decision Rule:

if confidence < 0.4:
    reject report
else:
    proceed

---

### Role of ML:
- detect real infrastructure damage
- filter junk/spam submissions

---

### ML Limitations:
- does NOT determine severity
- does NOT detect duplicates
- does NOT ensure intent

---

## 3. IPFS STORAGE (via Pinata)

### Step 1: Generate Timestamp

const timestamp = Date.now();

---

### Step 2: Upload Images

Each image MUST be renamed:

timestamp_1.jpg  
timestamp_2.png  
timestamp_3.jpg  

---

### Step 3: Store Image References

[
  {
    "name": "1712345678_1",
    "url": "ipfs://CID1"
  }
]

---

### Step 4: Create JSON Bundle

{
  "timestamp": 1712345678,
  "description": "Road damaged near bridge",
  "images": [
    {
      "name": "1712345678_1",
      "url": "ipfs://CID1"
    }
  ]
}

---

### Step 5: Upload JSON File

File name:
timestamp.json

---

### Output:
finalCID

This CID represents the complete report.

---

## 4. BACKEND (Relayer + Identity + Control Layer)

Backend responsibilities:

- receive validated report CID
- generate identity_hash
- convert ML confidence
- sign blockchain transaction

---

### Step 1: Identity Hash

identity_hash = HMAC(server_secret, Aadhaar)

(MVP: use dummy hash)

---

### Step 2: Confidence Scaling

confidence = ML_output × 100

---

### Step 3: Call Smart Contract

submitReport(
  cid,
  identity_hash,
  confidence
)

---

## 5. BLOCKCHAIN (Smart Contract)

### Function:

submitReport(
  string cid,
  bytes32 identityHash,
  uint256 confidence
)

---

### Stored Data:

CID → points to IPFS JSON  
identityHash → pseudonymous user ID  
confidence → ML score (0–100)  
timestamp → block.timestamp  

---

### Enforced Rules:

- only backend can submit
- banned users blocked
- immutable record storage

---

## 6. IDENTITY DESIGN

### Current MVP:

identityHash = keccak256("demo-user")

---

### Final Design:

identityHash = HMAC(server_secret, Aadhaar)

---

### Properties:

- stable per user
- non-reversible
- privacy-preserving
- enables accountability without revealing identity

---

## 7. DATA FLOW (COMPLETE)

Frontend:
  user uploads images + text  
↓  
ML API:
  returns confidence  
↓  
Frontend:
  if confidence >= 0.4  
    → upload images to IPFS  
    → create JSON  
    → upload JSON → get CID  
↓  
Frontend → Backend:
  send CID  
↓  
Backend:
  generate identityHash  
  call smart contract  
↓  
Blockchain:
  store CID + metadata

# ⚖️ SYSTEM GUARANTEES

## ✅ Ensures:
- real-world image validation (ML)
- tamper-proof storage (blockchain)
- decentralized data storage (IPFS)
- pseudonymous accountability

---

## ❌ Does NOT ensure (MVP):
- full decentralization
- perfect truth detection
- duplicate prevention
- intent validation

---

# 🧠 DESIGN PRINCIPLES

## 1. Accessibility First
- no crypto wallet required
- simple UI for common users

---

## 2. Trust Minimization
- backend only signs transactions
- blockchain ensures immutability

---

## 3. Off-chain Computation
- ML and storage handled off-chain
- blockchain used only for proof

---

## 4. Deterministic Structuring
- timestamp-based naming
- consistent data format

---

# 📦 DATA STRUCTURE SUMMARY

## Images:
timestamp_1.jpg  
timestamp_2.jpg  

---

## JSON:
{
  "timestamp": 1712345678,
  "description": "...",
  "images": [...]
}

---

## Blockchain:
CID → JSON pointer  
identityHash → user ID  
confidence → ML score  

---

# 🚀 FUTURE EXTENSIONS

- DID-based identity
- reputation scoring system
- geolocation clustering
- duplicate detection
- zero-knowledge proofs
- DAO-based validation

---

# 🧠 FINAL ONE-LINER

Reports are validated using ML, stored on IPFS, and immutably recorded on blockchain with pseudonymous identity.
